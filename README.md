# evolutional-algorithm
implement applications based on evolutional algorithm

using c++ and openGL

3a Develop a 3D physics simulator•Demonstrate a bouncing cube and a “breathing” cube

3b Evolve a fixed-shape robot•Manually design a robot, evolve a controller to make it move

3c Evolve both the shape and behavior of a robot•Demonstrate a moving robot of various shapes and behavoors
